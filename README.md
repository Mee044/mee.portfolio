# Mee's Data Analytics Portfolio

This is a modern, responsive portfolio website showcasing my expertise as a Data Analyst and Creative Problem Solver. The site features a clean, professional design with smooth animations and interactive elements, built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. It highlights my skills in data analysis, data visualization, web design, and graphic design, along with featured projects including data analytics projects on GitHub, educational tutorial videos on YouTube, and interactive dashboards on Tableau Public.

The portfolio is designed with a contemporary aesthetic featuring a light blue color scheme, glassmorphism effects, and engaging hover animations. It includes sections for About Me, Skills & Expertise, Featured Projects, and Contact information, making it easy for potential employers and collaborators to learn about my background and get in touch. The site is fully responsive and optimized for all devices, providing an excellent user experience across desktop and mobile platforms.
